# Background

Grew up in a single family household with my mother and little sister in New Jersey. Played baseball, football, and basketball growing up and was able to continue playing baseball in college and bounced around in semi-pro leagues as well as a season in Austria. Began working as a personal trainer during my college years and eventually progressed into a strength and conditioning coach and sport scientist. 

While working as a strength and conditioning coach (CSCS) for over 10-years I was fortunate enough to work with various CEO's, A-list celebrities, collegiate, professional and Olympic athletes. I served as an executive director of training for MicrogateUSA (sport science equipment manufacturer), director of sports science at an USTA regional tennis facility, sport scientst at Sports Science Integration, and the director of health and fitness at The Effortless Life Operating System (TELOS). Through this I've had the pleasure of conducting athletic evaluations and sports science consulting for athletes and teams in the NFL, NHL, NBA, MLB, USOC, USTA, PSA, US SKI, and USA Baseball. I've also been fortunate to have at least one of my playerâ€™s compete in a ATP/WTA Major Grand Slam tournament from 2013 until I left for my Ph.D. (2019).

I'm currently completing my Ph.D. as part of the Exercise Psychophysiology Laboratory (ExPPL) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research interests include examining the reciprocal relationship of combined physical and cognitive movements on brain activity, cognition, and behavioral outcomes.

## Spare time + Sport analytics

I'm a huge statistics nerd. Had begun minoring in statistics as part of my Ph.D. until COVID-19 hit. I enjoy employing different statistical models and simulations with sports data in R (obviously). I'm currently attempting to develop a cognitive/mental performance score of athletes based on theory and advanced modeling (e.g., latent variable, structural models).

## Family

I have a younger sister (Jessica), two amazing dogs (Nike & Saylor), and beautiful wife (Kerry).
