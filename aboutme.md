# Background

Grew up in a single family household with my mother and little sister in New Jersey. Play baseball, football, and basketball growing up and was able to continue playing baseball in college and bounced around in a bunch of semi-pro leagues (plus a season in Austria YaY!). Started working as a personal trainer during my college years and eventually progressed into a strength and conditioning coach and sport scientist. 

Like I said I had worked for over 10 years as a strength and conditioning coach (CSCS) compiling a deep resume of working with various CEO's, A-list celebrities, collegiate, professional and Olympic athletes. I've served as an executive director of training for MicrogateUSA, director of sports science at Magnus/Courtsense tennis facility, Sport Scientst at Sports Science Integration, and currently the director of health and fitness at The Effortless Life Operating System (TELOS). Through this I've had the pleasure of conducting athletic evaluations and sports science consulting for athletes and teams in the NFL, NHL, NBA, MLB, USOC, USTA, PSA, US SKI, and USA Baseball. I've also been fortunate to have at least one of my playerâ€™s compete in a ATP/WTA Major Grand Slam tournament from 2013 until I left for my PhD (2019).

I'm currently completing my Ph.D. as part of the Exercise Psychophysiology Laboratory (ExPPL) in the Department of Kinesiology & Community Health at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research interests revolve around examining the reciprocal relationship of combined physical and cognitive movements on brain activity, cognition, and behavioral outcomes with the objective of developing and implementing community-based interventions.

## Family

I have a younger sister (Jessica), amazing dog (Nike), and beautiful wife (Kerry).
