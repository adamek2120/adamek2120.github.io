Currently, I studying for my Ph.D. as part of the Exercise, Technology, and Cognition lab at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Previously, I had worked for over 10 years as a strength and conditioning coach (CSCS) compiling a deep resume of working with various CEO's, A-list celebrities, collegiate, professional and Olympic athletes. Prior to beginning a career as a researcher, I served as an Executive Director of Training for MicrogateUSA, Director of Health and Fitness at The Effortless Life Operating System (TELOS), and operated a consulting business at Sports Science Integration. Through this I've had the pleasure of conducting athletic evaluations and sports science consulting for athletes and teams in the NFL, NHL, NBA, MLB, USOC, USTA, PSA, US SKI, and USA Baseball. I've also been fortunate to have at least one of my playerâ€™s compete in a ATP/WTA Major Grand Slam tournament from 2013 until I left for my PhD (2019).

My research interest revolve around physical activity and exercise interventions and its influence on cognitive and psychosocial outcomes.

I'm an avid sports fan and a big fan of the R programming language
