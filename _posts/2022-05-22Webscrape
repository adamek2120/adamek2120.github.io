After a while it becomes tiredsome downloading data into a csv/excel file and then inputting it into R (or whatever software you use). There will be times when this might be the only choice but when we can it would be best to always scrape data from the web. This ensures that the data being pulled is always up to date.

When I first started learning R I was also taking statistic courses at the University of Illinos at Urbana-Champaign. One course focused on probability theory and Bayesian statistics. About this same time, sports betting was becoming legal and a popular betting type on MLB games was betting whether there would be a run scored in the first inning. At the time, the market was VERY favorable giving near even money (-110) for yes/no. Funny enough, this lasted barely a year until Vegas and all sport bookies caught on and adjusted the 1st inning moneyline so the return is less. Regardless, this is still a useful code and there are many other applications you can use with this. 

What this script does below is pulls in each teams 1st inning score percentage and their opponents 1st inning score percentage.
